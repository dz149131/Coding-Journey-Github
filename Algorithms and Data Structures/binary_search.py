# The given Python code defines a function called binary_search that performs a binary search on a sorted list to find the index position of a target element. The function takes two arguments, a sorted list and a target element, and returns the index position of the target element if found in the list, else returns None.

# The binary_search function initializes two variables, first and last, to the indices of the first and last elements of the list, respectively. It then uses a while loop to repeatedly divide the search interval in half until the target element is found or the search interval is empty.

# At each iteration of the loop, the function calculates the midpoint of the search interval using the formula (first + last)//2. If the midpoint element of the list is equal to the target element, the function returns the index position of the midpoint. If the midpoint element is less than the target, the search is continued in the right half of the search interval by updating the first index to be midpoint + 1. If the midpoint element is greater than the target, the search is continued in the left half of the search interval by updating the last index to be midpoint - 1.

# If the target element is not found after iterating through the entire list, the function returns None.

# The code also defines another function called verify that takes an index position as an argument and prints a message indicating whether the target element was found at that index or not.

# Finally, the code creates a sorted list of numbers and calls the binary_search function with a target value of 6. The index position of the target value is stored in a variable called result, which is then passed to the verify function to print a message indicating whether the target element was found in the list or not.
