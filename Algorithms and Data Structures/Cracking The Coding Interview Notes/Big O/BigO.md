## Constant Time: **0(1)**

>

```js
   i := 0
   while i < 11 Do
   i = i + i
```

---

## Logarithmic Time: **O(log(n))**

```js
  i := 0
while i < n Do
i = i +1
```

---

## Linear Time: **(O)n**

---

## Linearithmic Time: **0(nlog(n))**

---

## Quadric Time: **O(n^2)**

---

## Cubic Time: **O(n^3)**

---

## Exponential Time: **O(b^n), b > 1**
